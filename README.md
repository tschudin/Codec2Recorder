# A simple Codec2 Recorder for Android

"Codec 2 is an open source speech codec designed for communications
quality speech between 700 and 3200 bit/s."
[Codec2 homepage](http://rowetel.com/codec2.html)

Based on the [Codec2 library](https://github.com/drowe67/codec2), this
Android app permits to record voice, prehear the result of the
compression at self-chosen levels, and to save the compressed voice as
a ```*.c2``` file. Codec2-encoded files can also be played back.
