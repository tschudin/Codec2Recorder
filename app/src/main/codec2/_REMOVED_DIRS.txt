For this Android app "Codec2Recorder", the following directories have
been removed from the included Codec2 1.0.3 source tree due to their
size (16M), and not being necessary to build the libcodec2 library:

  octave
  raw
  stm32
  wav

Please see the GitHub repo https://github.com/drowe67/codec2
for the full Codec2 distribution.
